# What:
A system that reads changing data and acts on it.
Okay, thats a bit generic.
It reads RSS/ATOM feeds and performs actions on that data.

# Why:
I dislike the way information is provided on most websites.
I want to be able to control and categorize the data how I want to.

# How:
I like [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/), mainly becuase it allows for a local-first approach.
Given the nature of the data that is cental to the system, I am not worried about eventual consistency.
I may also just use sqlite or plain files.:wq

# Current Status (2022-02):
I have functioning parts, but not a whole.
I am rewriting the parts and adding them to this repo as I finish them.
